# Vendored X API OpenAPI Spec

This directory contains a checked-in copy of X's public OpenAPI spec, used at build time to generate the auth-method
matrix in `crates/xdk/src/api/auth_matrix.rs` (see `crates/xdk/build.rs`).

## Refresh

Run from the repo root before each release cycle:

```bash
scripts/refresh-x-openapi.sh
```

The script downloads the current spec, validates it as JSON, replaces this directory's copy, and rewrites this README
through `scripts/render-vendor-readme.sh`. The CI drift check (`.github/workflows/spec-drift.yml`) flags divergence
between runs and, depending on the trigger, writes a job summary, comments on the PR, or opens a refresh PR to `dev`.

## Why vendor?

A checked-in spec gives reproducible builds (Homebrew bottle CI, offline builds), an auditable supply chain (the spec is
greppable from source), and CI that does not need to reach `api.x.com` on every push. Manual refresh is the trade-off we
accept; the drift-check workflow shortens time-to-notice.
