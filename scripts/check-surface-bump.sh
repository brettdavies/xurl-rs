# (xurl-rs)` block names no minor-or-higher section.
#
# RELEASES.md § Versioning lets each PR's changelog section decide the version
# bump, and an addition to the contract is a minor. An addition filed under
# `### Changed` reads as a patch and nothing in review makes it stand out, so
# this compares the surface two trees describe:
#
#   - every command, subcommand, flag, and enumerated flag value, read from
#     completions/xr.bash, which the `Completions freshness` job holds equal
#     to the clap definition;
#   - every leaf of every schema under schema/ except `description` and
#     `title`, so a new envelope key, `reason`, `action`, or response field
#     counts and reworded prose does not.
#
# Growth passes when the block has a bullet under `### Added`, `### Deprecated`,
# or `### Breaking changes`. A removal only warns: the convention allows a
# change back to the documented contract as a patch, and the release preflight
# diffs every removal against the last tag. Env vars, exit codes, and the store
# format have no generated artifact and are not compared. The `xdk-rs` block is
# not read, because before 1.0 an addition and a change both move the library's
# last number, so filing one as the other cannot change its version.
#
# Usage:
#   check-surface-bump.sh surface <tree>
#   check-surface-bump.sh check <base-tree> <head-tree> <pr-body-file>
#
# Exit codes: 0 = pass, 1 = the surface grew and the block lacks the section,
# 2 = a usage error or a tree the parser cannot read.
