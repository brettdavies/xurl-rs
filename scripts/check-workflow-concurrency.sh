# Fails when a workflow's `concurrency.group` begins with an expression rather
# than a literal token naming the workflow that owns it, and when a caller
# invokes one reusable several times while that reusable owns a group.
#
# Why the rule exists: inside a called workflow, `github.workflow` resolves to
# the *caller's* workflow name. A group keyed only on context is therefore a key
# a caller also produces for itself, both land in one group, and when either
# side cancels in progress the called workflow's queue cancels the run that
# called it. The run concludes failure with every visible job green and the
# called workflow's jobs missing, and nothing in the logs names a cause.
#
# A literal prefix is the part a caller and a callee cannot both produce by
# accident, because it names a file rather than a run.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = every group is namespaced and owned (or none is declared),
# 1 = a violation, named with its file and line.

Key each concurrency group on a literal token naming the workflow that owns it:

Keep any context parts that separate callers and refs; lead with the literal.

A reusable a caller invokes more than once per run declares no workflow-level
group: nothing available in that block distinguishes one call from another, so
every call collides. Let the caller own the group, or move the group onto a job
inside the reusable and key it on inputs that differ between calls:

  jobs:
    deploy:
      concurrency:
        group: deploy-${{ inputs.environment }}-${{ inputs.config-path }}
