# Build the release branch: a clean descendant of main carrying dev's tree.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/release/cut-release-branch.sh [options] <version>
#
# `main` and `dev` share only an ancient merge-base, because every release
# squash-merges into main. Merging them, or cutting the release branch from
# dev, produces rename/delete and lockfile conflicts that are artifacts of the
# lineage rather than of the content shipping. So the release branch is built as
# a descendant of main with dev's tree asserted on top, and this script does the
# mechanical part of that: branch, overlay, strip the guarded paths, stage, and
# verify.
#
# It stops before committing. The commit, the preflight run, the push and the PR
# stay with the operator, because those are the steps that publish.
#
# Options:
#   --dry-run        Print the plan and touch nothing. Implies --no-drift.
#   --base BRANCH    Branch the release descends from (default: main)
#   --head BRANCH    Branch whose tree is overlaid (default: dev)
#   --branch NAME    Release branch name (default: release/v<version>)
#   --no-drift       Skip the drift gate. Only when drift.sh already passed.
#   --no-changelog   Skip generate-changelog.py even when it is present.
#   -h, --help       This text.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 = the branch is staged and every verification passed
#   1 = a verification failed; the branch is left in place to inspect
#   2 = setup error (dirty worktree, unknown ref, missing dependency)
#
# The worktree must be clean. The overlay resets the index and the working tree
# to the head branch's tree, which would silently discard uncommitted work.
#
# What it deliberately does NOT do: bump the version carriers. That is
# project-specific (each repo records its own in RELEASES.md § Project
# specifics), and guessing at it is how a release ships a half-bumped manifest.
# The script prints the reminder and leaves the edit to the operator.
